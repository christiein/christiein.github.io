Jekyll supports a flexible way to build your site’s URLs. You can specify the
permalinks for your site through the [Configuration](../configuration/) or in
the [YAML Front Matter](../frontmatter/) for each post. You’re free to choose
one of the built-in styles to create your links or craft your own. The default
style is `date`.
